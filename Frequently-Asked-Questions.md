## I'd like to talk to you

<div>Join us on Discord! </div>

Find us on [TeamSpeak](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) at our server "aura.actionfps".

Also join us on [#woop-clan @ GameSurge](https://webchat.gamesurge.net/?channels=woop-clan) IRC channel.

## Which servers do you record from?

See the [servers](https://actionfps.com/servers/) page.

## Any rules for play?

Be fair.

## What are your plans?

Expand. We want your participation.

## What is the MatchClient?

The MatchClient is a custom client we made to better suits the needs of clanwars. With it you will be able to access compatible servers that support features like `/pause`!

## Why should I [register](https://actionfps.com/login/)?

When registering, it creates your profile page where you can find statistics about all your games on our servers. You will also unlock achievements while playing!

## Why Google sign in?

Saves us time in development.

## Can I change the in-game name i picked while registering?

In the current state you are not able to change it. However if the name change is necessary (i.e joined or left a clan..) then you can complete this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10DqKjc8YxnpQ7llI2E2AT4ceYtypzZg0d5LD4lRTe0E/viewform) and we will do it for you.

## Why are some games circled with blue on the frontpage?

This means that the games are happenning right now ! The real time game display allows you to see the score of a game in real time on your browser!

## Should I accept notifications?

Yes! When you are registered on the website, you are able to use an inter finding feature we created. Go on any of our [servers](https://actionfps.com/servers/), then type `!inter`. This will send a notification on people's browser with a link to join the inter. There is a spam protection, doing it once is enough.

## How to complete a Clan War?

In order to complete a Clan War, you need to play at least 2 consecutive games against the same clan. Moreover, if these games resulted in 2 ties or 1 win for both clans, a third game has to be played as a tie breaker.

## How can I support the project?

By registering and playing ! You can also post your ideas and feedback on the forum. Don't hesitate to report any [issue](https://github.com/ScalaWilliam/ActionFPS/issues) you have. If you are willing to be actively participating in the development then join on on Gitter!
